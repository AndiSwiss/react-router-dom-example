# Demo App for React-router-dom v6 (with React State and React Context)

This app is extended from the original example from https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/blob/main/docs/start/_tutorial.md with:
- Using React State with the hook [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usestate)
- Using React Context with the hook [useContext](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usecontext)
- Some refactorings
